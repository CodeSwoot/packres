# packres
Create an .exe package that contains the app resources.
For example, a file called codeswift.exe requires that the swift.pkg file be in its own folder. Packres injects the swift.pkg file into the .exe file, so that it is included in the .exe file. The file is compressed with LZMA Ultra technology.
